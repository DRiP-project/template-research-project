# Title: 

==Steps to determine if an idea can lead to a research project==

## The problem 

==A simple statement of the problem we’re trying to solve==

==‘we currently can’t do Y’, or ‘we want to do Y’==

## Why bother

==A summary of why the problem is important or why we care about solving it==

## Current solution and why they failed 

==A list of approaches that may be applied to ‘the problem’, even if they were not designed specifically for it==

==‘they fail’ is not saying that these are bad approaches, just that we _expect_ them not to work _for our problem_, even if they are excellent otherwise.== 

## If I had a solution, what would it look like? 

==The point of this is not actually to propose a solution, but to ‘map’ what kind of solution we expect==

==_CheckList example: == 
=A framework for testing, including categorization of different test types  
-A way to elicit tests from users  
-Software that makes the whole process easy=


## How do I know if I solved it? 

==_CheckList example:  
=- A lot of compelling examples of SOTA models failing tests, with gleaned insights  
=- A ‘user study’ with Microsoft engineers, where we (hopefully) show they find a bunch of (fixable) problems in their own models after writing tests._

## What are uncertainties? What has to be true for this to work? What can’t be true for this solution to work?

==This is about mapping out areas of high uncertainty and making sure we try to rule out things that would invalidate either the project or the sketch of a solution as quickly as possible.==

## Sketch of a plan

==The sketch is the operative word here. We only need a reasonable level of detail for the first couple of steps, and the first step is often some form of preliminary literature review==


==_CheckList example:  
=- Lit review  
=- Write tests for a SOTA sentiment analysis model  
=- Write tests for a couple of other models (paraphrase, SQuAD)  
=- Try to organize these into general principles  
=- Develop whatever tools are needed  
=- Case study with Microsoft person; Case study with researcher  
=- User study  
=- Write paper_


## Heuristic 1: Imagine a different future

==What type of impact could this project have if I succeed?== 
==you should have very high uncertainty around these estimates and be really careful about premature optimization==
==sometimes doing projects that don’t really ‘make sense’ based on your current beliefs and goals) is a good strategy to avoid missing great opportunities because you could not anticipate them==

## Heuristic 2: Make sure the ‘reward upper bound’ is high

==saying ‘high upper bound’ is a sufficient condition for a good project, but that ‘low upper bound’ is usually enough to reject a project, regardless of how you define ‘success’ or ‘rewards’== 
==advisor used to say that 1 great paper is worth more than 3 good ones, and I think that mindset is really helpful==

## Heuristic 3: Get more information

==gather additional information to refine the proposal and reduce uncertainty== 
==Pitch the project to a few people to see if they ‘buy’ your story, your estimate of its importance, and the downsides of current solutions==
==If you don’t get discouraged, negative feedback is great fodder for the ‘uncertainty’ part of the template, in giving you falsification hypotheses that you can go check and defend against==
